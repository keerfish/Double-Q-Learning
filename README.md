# Play Super Mario with Double Q Learning
This toy example of Reinforcement Learning demonstrates an implementation of Double Q-Learning to play Super Mario. [Super Mario]（https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.） is an arcade game developed and released by Nintendo in 1983. We chose Mario Bros. as our replay implementation example because [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/mario_rl_tutorial.html) supplied a detailed tutorial with this implementation for a comprehensive understanding of the Double Q-learning algorithm. It gives us very big convenience of environment setting, software installation, programming running, and results tuning.
